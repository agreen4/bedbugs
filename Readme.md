## Project Background
This project is associated with the SESYNC Pursuit "The Sociospatial Ecology of Bedbugs". Our project connects population biologists, urban planners, and health researchers to examine the interrelationship between bedbug and human populations, municipal regulation, and pest management approaches.

#Project Goals
- Import public database of municipal code violations associated with bedbugs
- Develop a mapping application that allows for the querying and spatial visualization of violations
- Add to mapping and analytical outputs demographic information drawn from Census and American Community Survey data
- (maybe) develop predicted probabilities of future clusters of bedbug infestations based upon certain criteria
