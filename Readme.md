#Project Goals
- Import public database of municipal code violations associated with bedbugs
- Develop a mapping application that allows for the querying and spatial visualization of violations
- Add to mapping and analytical outputs demographic information drawn from Census and American Community Survey data
- (maybe) develop predicted probabilities of future clusters of bedbug infestations based upon certain criteria
